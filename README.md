# rescript-react-with-elixir

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Watch and recompile changed rescript files with `(cd assets && npm run re:start&)`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Those files are changed to install @reason/react
  * assets/package.json
  * assets/webpack.config.js
  * assets/bsconfig.js

Rescript files are in `assets/re`
